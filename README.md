Extract links from youtube videos for download
A fun challenge I set myself after working one night when I discovered an api on rapid api for getting direct links to download video or audio files from almost any hosting website, like Youtube, Twitch, SoundCloud, etc.

You can find the api [here](https://rapidapi.com/Top-Rated/api/get-video-and-audio-url) 😃
